# Uni_Map
This is the repository of the University of Adelaide's map, yet to be released.
We aim to create an interactive map to find the optimal route to travel on the Uni's North Terrace campus.

We will implement this by using c++ for the backend, Node.js for the conversion of c++ to js, and react.js for the frontend
